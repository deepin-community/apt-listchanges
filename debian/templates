Template: apt-listchanges/frontend
Type: select
__Choices: pager, browser, xterm-pager, xterm-browser, gtk, text, mail, none
Default: pager
_Description: Method to be used to display changes:
 Changes in packages can be displayed in various ways by apt-listchanges:
 .
  pager        : display changes one page at a time;
  browser      : display HTML-formatted changes using a web browser;
  xterm-pager  : like pager, but in an xterm in the background;
  xterm-browser: like browser, but in an xterm in the background;
  gtk          : display changes in a GTK window;
  text         : print changes to the terminal (without pausing);
  mail         : only send changes via e-mail;
  none         : do not run automatically from APT.
 .
 This setting can be overridden at execution time. By default, all the
 options except for 'none' will also send copies by mail.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-address
Type: string
Default: root
_Description: E-mail address(es) which will receive changes:
 Optionally, apt-listchanges can e-mail a copy of displayed changes to
 a specified address.
 .
 Multiple addresses may be specified, delimited by commas. Leaving this
 field empty disables mail notifications.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-format
Type: select
__Choices: text, html
Default: text
_Description: Format of e-mail messages:
 Please choose a format for e-mail copies of the displayed changes -
 either plain text or HTML with clickable links.

Template: apt-listchanges/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Prompt for confirmation after displaying changes?
 After displaying the list of changes, apt-listchanges can pause with
 a confirmation prompt. This is useful when running from APT, as it
 offers an opportunity to abort the upgrade if a change is unwelcome.
 .
 This can be overridden at execution time, and has no effect if the
 configured frontend option is 'mail' or 'none'.

Template: apt-listchanges/headers
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Insert headers before changelogs?
 apt-listchanges can insert a header before each package's changelog
 showing the name of the package, and the names of the binary packages
 which are being upgraded (when different from the source package name).
 .
 Note however that displaying headers might make the output a bit harder
 to read as they might contain long lists of names of binary packages.

Template: apt-listchanges/no-network
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Disable retrieving changes over network?
 In rare cases when a binary package does not contain a changelog file,
 apt-listchanges by default executes the command "apt-get changelog",
 which tries to download changelog entries from the network.
 .
 This option can disable this behavior, which might for example be
 useful for systems with limited network connectivity.

Template: apt-listchanges/reverse
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Show changes in reverse order?
 By default apt-listchanges shows changes for each package in the order
 of their appearance in the relevant changelog or news files - from the
 most recent version of the package to the oldest.
 .
 Optionally apt-listchanges can display changes in the opposite order,
 which some may find more natural: from the oldest changes in the
 package to the newest.

Template: apt-listchanges/save-seen
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changes that have already been seen?
 A record of already displayed changes can be kept in order to avoid
 displaying them again. This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.

Template: apt-listchanges/which
Type: select
__Choices: news, changelogs, both
Default: news
_Description: Changes displayed with APT:
 Please choose which type of changes should be displayed with APT.
 .
  news      : important news items only;
  changelogs: detailed changelogs only;
  both      : news and changelogs.
