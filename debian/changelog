  * Add  `--no-network' option that can be used to disable calls to
    `apt-get changelog' (closes: #866583) and document it in the man page.
  * Rework handling of the LESS variable: instead of overriding it, detect
    if it contains harmful settings, and try to disable them by appending
    `-+E' or `-+F' options (closes: #867144).
  * Improve handling of configuration file by debconf-helper.py:

    + set the debconf's `seen' flag for items that already exist in the
      configuration file;

apt-listchanges (3.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix changelog parser to mark files as being in the Debian changelog
    format *before* checking if the latest version has been seen already.
  * Refactor apt-listchanges.py to remove duplicated code.
  * Rewrite main loop of program in order to limit a number of calls to
    `apt-get changelog':
    1. First group packages by the source package and next process all binary
       packages from the same source package at once.
    2. Sort the  packages in each group by their binary versions descending.
    3. Exclude those of them whose versions were already seen or are lower
       (except for the binnmu suffix) than the maximal version, i.e. the
       version of the first package in the group.
    4. Process the remaining packages until valid changelog or news entries
       are found, and call `apt-get changelog' on the first package if and
       only if no such changelog entries are found, and apt-listchanges is
       not configured to display the news entries only.
  * Override the LESS environment variable to make sure it does not contain
    certain flags like -F that might cause less program to quit before even
    user is able to see the files generated by the program.
  * Fix an issue with showing changelog entries with unrecognised urgencies
    (see #866358): map such an urgency to a non-zero value and use proper
    `is None' check for testing the mapped value.
  * Fix an exception, introduced in 2.87,  occurring when the `--since' option
    is used with the invalid number of `.deb' files. Clarify the error message
    shown in such a case.
  * In the `--verbose' mode when apt-listchanges is configured to display
    `news' only append the informational notes to the news entries instead
    of creating changelog entries.
  * Don't permit `--since' and `--show-all' to be used together. Also make
    sure that passing one of them in the command line overrides any eventual
    config file setting related to the other one.
  * Fix a spelling typo in `retrieve' (closes: #866644).

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Fix a bug in the `skipping reading other changelog files when all the
    entries were filtered out' functionality introduced in version 3.3:
    if the currently parsed file is not in the Debian changelog format,
    than return an empty urgency from the changelog parser so that remaining
    files are not omitted.
  * Call python3 from /usr/bin in postinst and config scripts, as otherwise
    the scripts might fail to load the debconf.py module (closes: #855069).
  * Makefile: add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nodoc.
  * Standards-Version: 4.0.0.

  * Apply patch from Ubuntu to use the `apt-get changelog' command if the
    extracted package does not provide changelog file.
  * Enhance the above patch:
    + call `apt-get' with the `-qq' option, so that it won't put additional
      lines at the top of changelog that prevented apt-listchanges from
      recognizing it as valid Debian changelog;
    + fix invalid python2 syntax in exception handler;
    + set timeout (120 seconds) for the apt-get command, just in case;
    + capture stderr of apt-get and display it as part of apt-listchanges'
      error message.

    cannot be loaded. Thanks to synaptic shouldn't appear to hang any
    more (closes: #836433).

  * Fix the security issue introduced in version 3.2: make config and postinst
    scripts create new directory (with the help of `mktemp') for the helper
    Python script they execute (closes: #837534).
  * When aptitude/synaptic/etc. is used to install new upgrades without being
    restarted after apt-listchanges upgrade, it might happen that the value
    of APT_HOOK_INFO_FD is still 0. Do not fail on such a value, but display
    a warning instead (closes: #835046, LP: #1614191).
  * Print a warning message if an e-mail cannot be sent (closes: #835375).

  * Update Dutch translation (closes: #823974).
  * Introduce simple ALCLog class for consistent logging.
  * Rename ALSeen.py into ALCSeen.py.
  * More improvements of changelog files parsing:
    + don't try to parse `changelog.gz' file when `changelog.Debian.gz' was
      successfully read, but all its entries were filtered out (e.g. because
      they had already been seen, what can happen while processing binNMU-ed
      packages);
    + also stop reading changelog file if the first non-empty line does
      not contain valid Debian changelog header;
  * Drop support for ancient *.deb files:
    + don't look for changelog files in `/usr/doc' directories;
    + assume all paths in tarballs created by `dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile'`
      will start with the `./' prefix.
  * Regenerate *.pot and *.po files.
  * Update Polish translation.
  * Update debian/NEWS with a summary of the changes in versions 3.x.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Aug 2016 21:55:31 +0200

apt-listchanges (3.2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Improve parsing of changelog entries: ignore Emacs stuff and comments
    (closes: #336739), and try to recognize ancient changelog headers, so that
    they are shown in the proper order when `--reverse --show-all' is used.
  * Handle a few signals in apt-listchanges, and update the exit status check
    in the apt config file to break the installation  not only when the status
    is equal to 10, but also when it is greater than 10 (closes: #816054).
  * Move the code responsible for reading apt pipeline to new ALCApt module,
    refactor it, and add support for reading from file descriptor given in
    $APT_HOOK_INFO_FD instead of stdin.  This requires InfoFD option to be
    set in the apt configuration file.
  * Avoid reopening /dev/tty when stdin/stdout is already attached to terminal,
    make ttyconfirm use Python's input() method instead, so that it should work
    correctly when 'su -c apt-get' is used for upgrades (closes: #663738).
  * Use named arguments in format strings to fix gettext warnings.
  * Rework debconf handling not to use debconf as a registry (closes: #521403).
    Introduce debian/debconf-helper.py, that gets inlined into postinst
    and config, and use configparser module for reading and writing our
    configuration file.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2016 15:37:50 +0200

apt-listchanges (3.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Drop root privileges when running commands spawned by browser,
    xterm-browser, and xterm-pager frontends (closes: #456454):
    + a non-privileged user is selected by examining the APT_LISTCHANGES_USER,
      SUDO_USER, and USERNAME environment variables;
    + if temporary directory name ends with '/0', then it is modified to end
      with '/<uid-of-new-user>';
    + a few environment variables (HOME, SHELL, LOGNAME, TMPDIR, etc.)
      are updated;
    + os.spawnl() call was replaced with subprocess.Popen() with its env, and
      preexec_fn params set properly (BTW. this also mean that shell is no
      longer involved in running the commands).
    All the above steps are needed, because `su -c' cannot be used, because it
    detaches from the controlling terminal...
    The pager frontend still runs its command as root, so that it can be usable
    in case of any errors in the implementation of the above logic.

  * Update man page for the above change. Apply some other minor fixes to it.
  * Close temporary files explicitly to have a chance to ignore an error when
    the file has been removed already (closes: #772663).
  * Exit with an error when invalid command line option is given.
  * Permit '+' character in e-mail address while converting output to html.

  * Move the code responsible for handling the seen database to new ALSeenDb.py
    module and:
    + handle the fact that ndbm in python3 adds the '.db' extension by itself,
      and update the postinst script to rename the spurious '.db.db' file
      created by version 3.0  (closes: #820732);
    + increase reliability of saving database changes, and store the previous
      version of the database in 'listchanges-old.db', also update the postrm
      script for the new file;
    + add '--dump-seen' option to display the contents of the database to
      stdout, and mention NFS-sharing in README.Debian (closes: #658444).

  * Mention `NEWS and/or changelog' in README.Debian (closes: #743366), and
    update the description of both the algorithm and recovery procedure.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.8.

  * Switch to python3 (closes: #796061).
    Merge James Lu's changes from his GitHub repository given in the
    bug report. Apart from the basic python3 syntax related updates,
    the change include replacing python-gtk2 and python-glade2 code
    with python3-gi for gtk frontend;
  * Use gettext() instead of lgettext() as a fix (or work-around)
    for an issue with python3 concatenating or not concatenating
    bytes to string depending on the current locale (see #818728).
  * Fix mail fronted to use 8bit encoding rather than base64 one.
    This requires python3 >= 3.5 for subprocess.run().
  * Apply more python3 fixes for exceptions occurring in legacy,
    non-UTF8 locales.
  * Enhance GTK frontend to display different labels for news
    items and changelogs.
  * Display titles in all other frontends as well (closes: #341917).
    Also make sure xterm-based frontends use the same settings as
    their console-based equivalents.
  * Handle local apt repositories with spaces in path (closes: #534434).
  * Fallback to non-xterm frontends when $DISPLAY is not set.
  * Drop support for deprecated frontends like w3m.
  * debian/control:
    + rename X-Python-Version control field to X-Python3-Version
      to get correct dependency on python3;
    + move dh-python from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends,
      it is needed for the clean target due to `dh --with python3';
    + sort dependency fields with the wrap-and-sort command.

  * Fix encoding of non-ASCII mails (closes: #604922).
  * Convert http(s) and ftp(s) URLs into links in the browser frontend
    (closes: #587399). Additionally do the same CVE/CAN identifiers,
    and switch to using https for the Debian BTS links.
  * Introduce the --email-format option to optionally send mails in
    the HTML format (closes: #689731).
  * Rename the --save_seen option to --save-seen to match names of
    other command line options that contain hyphens rather than
    underscores (closes: #707667). Also rename --all to --show-all
    to match the name of the configuration file option. (Both older
    options are supported for backward compatibility, but no longer
    documented in the man page).
  * Enhance apt-listchanges(1) man page:
    + describe the format of the configuration file together with
      possible values of boolean options (see #707667);
    + document that browser, pager, and xterm settings can include
      arguments (closes: #784781);
    + disambiguate description of changes ordering (closes: #594844).
  * Introduce --ignore-apt-assume option to disable switching into
    non-interactive mode in case of `apt-get -y' (closes: #818712).
  * Switch to the non-interactive mode when DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment
    variable is set to "noninteractive". Add --ignore-debian-frontend

    Assume we don't want to save our state in that case, and proceed as usual
    (Closes: 311919, 355399).

  * Use more clever regexps (even sub regexps!) to recognize Closes: 316531
    correctly (the recursion is a courtesy of Christoph Berg).

  * When upgrading from 2.51 or earlier, seed the apt-listchanges/which

apt-listchanges (2.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update debhelper compatibility level to 4 and remove debian/conffiles
  * Use debian/compat rather than DH_COMPAT
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes needed)
  * Add new debconf question to ask whether to display news, changelogs or
    both.  Ask it at low priority, and default to news (Closes: #222362)
  * Adjust priorities and defaults of debconf questions to be less
    intrusive, and oriented towards a wider range of users:
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/save-seen to low (almost
      everybody seems to want the default)
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/email-address to low
      (still mails root by default; scream if you think this should remain
      medium)
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/confirm to low, and change the
      default to false (no confirmation prompt)
    - End result: an installation at priority medium or higher will
      ask only one question (apt-listchanges/frontend), and display only
      NEWS.Debian items to the user on upgrades, with no confirmation
      prompt.  Feedback welcome.
  * Minor clarifications to some templates based on display of news as
    well as changelogs.  Mostly s/changelogs/changes/
  * With these changes, I think apt-listchanges would be suitable for
    priority: standard

  * Refactor lots of code, with many tangible benefits
    - Make only a single pass through the deb, extracting all files we
      might be interested in, no matter how many different files we are
      interested in.  This makes searching for NEWS.Debian free, and speeds
      up processing of packages with only native changelogs (no
      changelog.Debian
    - OOPify several interfaces
    - Use the gzip module rather than forking zcat (faster and cleaner)
  * Add 'which' option to specify whether news, changelogs or both should
    be displayed.  This is still very primitive and everything is
    concatenated together.
  * Simplify urgency sorting
  * Remove import from __future__ which is unnecessary now that we require
    Python 2.2 anyway

  * Experimental NEWS.Debian support, based on a patch from Joe Drew.
    NEWS.Debian has the same format as changelog.  Currently the only
    difference is that the NEWS.Debian entries for all packages are
    displayed ahead of any changelog entries.  In the future, there will
    likely be an option to display only NEWS entries and skip changelogs,
    and different frontends will be able to display the news differently

  * Updated Polish translation of message catalogs from Michal Politowski
    <mpol@charybda.icm.edu.pl> (Closes: #179071)
  * Don't specify the encoding for the subject if no locale is set; many
    MUAs don't deal with this correctly (Closes: #179947)

apt-listchanges (2.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use a shell variable named something other than BROWSER in the
    browser-pipe script, so that it doesn't clobber a BROWSER environment
    variable and cause sensible-browser to call itself recursively.
    Isn't the bourne shell wonderful?
    (Closes: #179366)
  * Use the current locale's character set to encode the Subject header of
    email messages.  Hopefully this matches the character set used by
    gettext, because gettext doesn't seem to want to tell me what it's
    using
    (Closes: #159122)

    message

apt-listchanges (2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the bug regex more useful.  It should now match a superset of the
    closes: syntax, while also trying to pick out plain-language bug
    references. (Closes: #141461)
  * Based on feedback about the w3m frontend, it seems a lot of folks
    prefer lynx.  Added a quick and dirty script which allows the user to
    specify a browser via the environment, or searches the path for some
    common browsers (Closes: #141457)
  * Use #!/usr/bin/python instead of #!/usr/bin/env python

apt-listchanges (2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I never forget a wishlist bug" release.
  * Add w3m frontend which creates HTML output with hyperlinks for bugs
    and email addresses, and a corresponding xterm-w3m frontend which does
    the same thing in an xterm in the background.  (Closes: #82360)
  * Only works with w3m for now, because that is the only browser that I
    am aware of which accepts input from a pipe.  Perhaps eventually, I
    will find a way to securely create temporary files for this purpose in
    Python, and any browser can be supported

    a significant performance improvement, around 10%
  * Send mail after displaying changelogs, rather than before
  * Fix some funny business with the progress indicator
  * More translation updates, though things still aren't up to date
  * Reference /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail

  * Add an error message for an unknown frontend (Closes: #129993)
  * Fix --help, usage() was lost when moving code to the module
    (Closes: #129992)
  * Get rid of the hackish 'run' configuration option, since frontend=none
    accomplishes the same purpose
  * Update the debconf templates to reflect several minor configuration
    differences

  * Fix instantiation of gettext classes (Closes: #129123)
  * Update Estonian translations of message catalogs, thanks to Ivar
    Smolin <okul@linux.ee>

apt-listchanges (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Python release
  * Complete rewrite in python, and lots of code cleanup
  * ATTENTION: The configuration file format has changed, it now uses
    python's ConfigParser.  Folks configuring based on the debconf
    questions should be migrated automagically.  Others will need to RTFM.
  * The newt frontend is gone, and good riddance.  Try the pager frontend,
    fix newt, or send me a patch for something better.
    (Closes: #78814, #94572, #126055)
  * Mail can now be sent in addition to running one of the usual
    frontends, using --email-address=me@there.  If this option is not
    specified, no mail is sent.  An argument of 'none' overrides a
    configured default. (Closes: #78448)
  * --nosaveseen is gone.  --saveseen now accepts an argument, which is
    the database file to use, so you can use different databases for
    different tasks.  --saveseen=none will act like the old --nosaveseen.
  * Get rid of the automake cruft and just do it by hand.  Automake was
    starting to do way too much unnecessary work
  * Document the config file format
  * Since this was as much a redesign as a rewrite, it is possible that an
    old bug or two may have crept back in; some of the logic is fragile
    due to lax standardization of certain aspects of Debian packaging.  I
    have squashed a few already as I have noticed them.  Send in those bug
    reports for ones that I may have missed.

apt-listchanges (1.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a --debug option to help with debugging future problems

apt-listchanges (1.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't get confused when there are no changelog entries for the
    newly-installed version of a package.  This should never happen, of
    course, but it just did with cracklib2.

  * Add fallback from xterm-pager to pager (Closes: #107211)
  * Fallback from pager->text, not pager->mail (what was I thinking?)
  * Rename apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf to apt.conf.d/20listchanges
    to meet the new filename restrictions in apt 0.5.4 (Closes: #109784)
  * Build-depend on autoconf >= 2.50-1, and run autoconf2.50, to work with
    the latest libtool

apt-listchanges (1.54) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jul 2001 17:46:03 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a feature to keep track of which changelogs have already been
    seen by the user, and accompanying debconf question, config file
    option, and command line option. (Closes: #77161, #103537)
  * A respectable bit of code cleanup.  A rewrite is probably called for,
    perhaps in a different language.  We'll wait and see.
  * Remember to read all of the pipeline data when using the 'none'
    frontend (Closes: #105701)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jul 2001 18:08:16 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for APT_LISTCHANGES_FRONTEND environment variable to
    allow easy frontend selection when apt-listchanges is being called by
    another program.
  * Added a new, snazzy frontend called 'none' which will cause
    apt-listchanges to exit without doing anything.
  * These two features can be used together to skip the changelogs for a
    particular run. (Closes: #77988, #105423)

apt-listchanges (1.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Galician translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@trasno.net>
  * Read .debs in the order in which apt will configure them.  This lets
    us find changelogs in the new perl, and may speed things up a bit for
    packages where .../doc/foo -> bar and foo Depends: bar.
    (Closes: #98442)
  * Fix up Makefile.in to work with the latest automake.  Use _SCRIPTS
    instead of _PROGRAMS, which I should have probably done in the first
    place.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 21:29:39 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Estonian translation of message catalogs, thanks to Ivar Smolin
    <okul@linux.ee>

    going to exit because we won't do anything.  If we don't, apt thinks
    we broke. (Closes: #96114)

apt-listchanges (1.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip "Local variables" section at end of changelog.  Really, this
    should never show up anyway, since we won't usually be displaying the
    last entry in the changelog.  It seems to come up anyway, usually
    during weird package splits/merges and the like. (Closes: #93332)
  * Still read the status file, even if we are getting some information
    from the apt pipeline.  apt doesn't give us the source package
    version, which we need to do our job.  Darn. (Closes: #93790)
  * Miscellaneous fixes to work with the most recent automake

apt-listchanges (1.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --version and --help options (Closes: #90929)
  * Automatically substitute package version from changelog into

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Mar 2001 02:20:42 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Finnish translation of message catalog, thanks to Jaakko
    Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>
  * Make urgency comparison case insensitive (to deal with urgency values
    like HIGH, used by a recent xfree86 upload).  This caused "Use of
    uninitialized value" warnings when such a value was encountered.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Mar 2001 20:08:19 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't display the per-package headers by default, as they can get in
    the way of an easy visual scan.  Instead, they can be turned on using
    the -h or --headers command line options.  Edit
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf and add the option there
    if you want the headers back. (Closes: #89821)
  * Add missing build-dependency on the new perl

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2001 23:33:43 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevent an obscure warning that only happened if apt-listchanges was
    run unconfigured.
  * Fix urgency sorting (broken in 1.36, I think)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2001 01:21:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * The text frontend will no longer display a progress indicator, so that
    its output can be usefully redirected to a file.
  * If APT::quiet has been set (e.g. by apt-get -q), apt-listchanges will
    force the text frontend to be used, so that apt-get -q output will be
    loggable.
  * Closes: #89511

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 17:25:04 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Parse the urgency value correctly, even when there are multiple
    key/value pairs in the changelog header (Closes: #89492)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 07:43:00 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Show which binary packages relate to the source packages for which
    changes are being displayed (Closes: #85572)
  * Now -w clean, as far as I can determine.  This may cause some warnings
    to be displayed under certain circumstances now; I will try to fix
    them as they come up.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2001 03:27:03 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Galician translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>
  * Modify apt.conf snippet to sanitize the exit code, so we don't cause
    apt to abort unless we really want to. (Closes: #88784)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Mar 2001 00:05:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now interface with apt by dropping a conffile in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.  This allows us to avoid sharing a config file
    with anyone else, and to have a defined execution order in relation
    to, e.g. dpkg-preconfigure.
  * debian/control: depend on apt (>= 0.5.3)
  * debian/control: depend on debconf (this should have been there long
    ago)
  * debian/rules: install /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf
  * debian/postinst: updated for apt 0.5 (no more apt.conf hackery!)
  * debian/postinst: added apt-mode-run config option, necessary for the
    new way of interfacing with apt
  * apt-listchanges.in: added apt-mode-run config option
  * Added Spanish translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jordi Mallach
    <jordi@debian.org>
  * apt-listchanges.sgml: Clarify the meaning of the --apt option

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Mar 2001 21:58:23 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on liblocale-gettext-perl (I forgot to commit this change along
    with the i18n changes in 1.32 (Closes: #85751, #85780)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Feb 2001 23:13:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-listchanges is now internationalized.  New catalogs can be added
    in the po/ directory.  Translations are welcome. (Closes: #85432)
  * The build system has been reworked to use automake, for easier
    integration with gettext

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Feb 2001 01:59:10 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finnish translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jaakko Kangasharju

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 17:20:54 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Korean translation of debconf templates, thanks to Eungkyu Song
    <eungkyu@sparcs.kaist.ac.kr>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Feb 2001 01:03:03 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Spanish translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jordi
    Mallach <jordi@debian.org>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Feb 2001 02:36:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Dutch translation of debconf templates, thanks to "Thomas
    J. Zeeman" <tjzeeman@cs.vu.nl> (Closes: #83947)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Jan 2001 18:23:26 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added French translation of debconf templates, thanks to Thomas Morin
    <thomas.morin@webmotion.com> (Closes: #83799)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Jan 2001 00:09:34 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in the urgency sorting code; some higher-priority entries
    would incorrectly be sorted equal to low-priority entries

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Jan 2001 14:28:59 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Swedish translation of debconf templates, thanks to André
    Dahlqvist <anedah-9@sm.luth.se>
  * Added German translation of debconf templates, thanks to Leonard
    Michlmayr <Leonard.Michlmayr@ap.univie.ac.at>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Jan 2001 00:28:11 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -a/--all option, which ignores version checks and just dumps the
    entire changelog (Closes: #82225)
  * Prompt whether or not to overwrite an existing
    /etc/apt/listchanges.conf (Closes: #80983)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Jan 2001 17:38:11 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle packages with different binary/source versions correctly
    (Closes: #82222)
  * Use Build-Depends-Indep rather than Build-Depends

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Jan 2001 18:01:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle apt-mode-confirm=no correctly (Closes: #81026)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Jan 2001 22:44:41 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added xterm-pager frontend, which starts an xterm in the background to
    display changes (Closes: #78662)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Dec 2000 21:16:05 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fall back from more complex to less complex frontends when
    initialization fails (Closes: #80477)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Dec 2000 20:23:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the name and meaning of the config file variable 'confirm' so
    that it only applies to apt mode.  A config file default for this
    doesn't make sense when running from the command line.(Closes: #80082)
  * Clean up old debconf questions that we don't ask anymore

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 23:15:38 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify and extend man page (Closes: #79698)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 00:58:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only ask for confirmation if there were changes to display

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Dec 2000 16:58:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug that caused apt-listchanges to run if no packages were being
    installed, only removed (Closes: #79479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 19:03:06 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * All interactive frontends now have the option of asking the user
    whether or not to continue, in a way appropriate for the selected
    frontend.  Right now, this is a simple text prompt for all of them.
    (Closes: #78552)
  * Configuration file moved to /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
  * Renamed debconf variables to suit their actual use (which turned out
    to be different from their intended one).  This will cause all
    questions to get asked again, but since there is a new question to ask
    anyway, nobody should mind too much.
  * Some support for the new apt (0.4), which gives us a lot more information
    in the pipeline in addition to the .deb filenames.  This means that we
    won't have to read the status file anymore.  There is also a newer and
    better way to configure our hook into apt, but we can't use it until
    there is a new released version of apt to Depend on.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Dec 2000 00:22:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only skip based on the source package name if we actually got changelogs
    from another binary package with the same source package.  This fixes
    a problem when processing multi-binary packages which symlink
    subdirectories in /usr/share/doc (e.g. xmms/xmms-dev).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 04:56:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't send empty messages when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77993)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 14:37:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make newt optional.  We only load it if the user is using the newt
    frontend, and fail with an informative message if it's unavailable.
    This also means we now Suggest newt, rather than depending on it, and
    it is no longer the default in debconf.  All you pager users can purge
    libnewt-perl and libnewt0 now.
  * Include the hostname when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77588)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Nov 2000 00:01:15 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always ignore the return value of the pager program...it's too
    unpredictable to use for making a decision.  I would like for the user
    to have some way to tell apt-listchanges to abort when using the pager
    frontend, but I'll have to find another way.  Once again, this
    hopefully Closes: #77421.
  * The patch to order changelog entries by urgency slipped out of 1.10.
    The functionality should be there now (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 19:58:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Order changelog entries by urgency (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 04:21:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to catch SIGPIPE when using the pager frontend
    (Closes: #77421)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 03:40:24 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented frontend and email-address options in manpage, corrected
    program name in manpage.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 04:46:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple frontend support added.  You can now choose to view
    changelogs with a pager, a simple text dump, via email, or with the
    old newt interface (Closes: #77186)
  * Remember to include the TODO list (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:10:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to remove ourselves from apt.conf if we are reconfigured
    using dpkg-reconfigure
  * Resize ourselves properly (Closes: #77236)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2000 18:12:31 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that would read the wrong changelog for Debian
    native packages (notably dpkg) which have both a changelog.gz and
    changelog.Debian.gz.
  * Use only one piece of whitespace to indent the debconf template
    description (Closes: #77157)
  * Updated TODO list
  * Strip entire path from .deb pathnames for the progress display, not
    just /var/cache/apt/archives.  This accounts for systems accessing a
    local mirror via apt (Closes: #77158)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Nov 2000 23:46:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated TODO list
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes necessary)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Nov 2000 15:56:55 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure we read the entire changelog (even if it is not displayed)
    to avoid a 'broken pipe' error when closing the pipe on a long
    changelog (first noticed with xext 3.3.6-12)
  * Removed extra space at the left margin of the description (thanks,
    lintian)
  * Enhanced description.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Nov 2000 20:55:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change maintainer email address

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Nov 2000 22:34:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debconf support.
  * Optionally add ourselves to /etc/apt/apt.conf when installed, and
    remove when we are removed.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 19:48:53 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package renamed to apt-listchanges

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 18:15:48 -0400

debchanges (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for packages whose source package version differs from the
    binary package version, and do the right thing.
  * Added a cancel button (causes exit with nonzero status).
  * Fixed a bug in the source package check that caused packages to be
    skipped when they shouldn't have been

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Tue, 17 Oct 2000 01:40:43 -0400

debchanges (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * It is not an error if --apt is specified and no package files are sent
    to stdin.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 23:09:26 -0400

debchanges (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only process one binary package from each source package (changelogs
    should be the same)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:19:39 -0700

debchanges (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that caused an empty dialog to be displayed (thanks to
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>>
  * Set Architecture: all (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 02:43:46 -0400

debchanges (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
