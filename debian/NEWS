apt-listchanges (3.14) unstable; urgency=low

  When displaying changelogs during upgrades is enabled, but no changelog
  file is provided by any of binary packages being processed together, then
  apt-listchanges will call `apt-get changelog' command to retrieve changes
  over network.  (Similar functionality has existed in Ubuntu for ages, and
  was incorporated into Debian a few versions ago.)

  If for some reason, like limited network connectivity, this behavior
  is undesirable, it can be now disabled with the new `--no-network' option
  that can be also set using debconf interface:

     dpkg-reconfigure apt-listchanges


  Additionally the debconf interface was improved to manage a few older
  configuration options, for example `--email-format'.

apt-listchanges (3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  Short summary of the most important changes done since version 3.0 up to 3.3:

  - apt-listchanges was migrated to python3.  The "gtk" frontend now requires
    the python3-gi package to work.

  - The "browser", "xterm-pager", and "xterm-browser" frontends will now try
    to drop root privileges before spawning external commands.  This only works
    when upgrade was initiated from a regular user account with commands like
       sudo|su  apt-get|aptitude  upgrade|install|etc.

  - The way apt-listchanges cooperates with apt was slightly changed; please
    make sure to accept the new version of `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20listchanges'
    configuration file in case dpkg prompts about the file.

  - apt-listchanges no longer supports deprecated frontends (e.g. "w3m")
    or ancient (i.e. more than about 15 years old) *.deb packages.

apt-listchanges (2.87) unstable; urgency=medium

  For better integration with package management system, apt-listchanges
  automatically switches to the non-interactive "text" frontend:
   - when the `-y'/`--assume-yes' option is passed to apt-get
   - or when DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable is set to "noninteractive".
  The new behavior can be disabled in the configuration file (or via the
  command-line parameters), refer to apt-listchanges(1) man page for details.

  The "mail" frontend can optionally send e-mails in the HTML format, see the
  description of `--email-format' option in the man page for more information.

  For the sake of consistency the `--all' and `--show_seen' options were
  renamed to `--show-all' and `--show-seen' respectively.
